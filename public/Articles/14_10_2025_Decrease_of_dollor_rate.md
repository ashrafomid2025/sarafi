# The Remarkable Decline: US Dollar Weakens Against the Resilient Afghan Afghani

## Introduction

In the midst of Afghanistan's complex economic landscape, marked by international sanctions and humanitarian dependencies, a surprising trend has emerged in 2025: the Afghan Afghani (AFN) is gaining ground against the mighty US Dollar (USD). As of October 14, 2025, the exchange rate stands at approximately 66.1 AFN per USD, a significant drop from the peak of 72.6790 AFN per USD recorded in April 2025. This decline in the dollar's value against the Afghani—effectively a strengthening of the local currency—has caught economists and traders off guard, offering a glimmer of hope for monetary stability in a nation long plagued by hyperinflation and currency volatility.

## Historical Context: From Turmoil to Trends

The Afghani's journey has been tumultuous. Introduced in 1925, it has weathered wars, regime changes, and economic isolation. In the early 1970s, one USD fetched around 67 AFN, but by the 1990s civil war, hyperinflation pushed it to 16,000 AFN per USD. Post-2021, under the current administration, the currency stabilized somewhat, but 2024 saw fluctuations between 68-70 AFN per USD.

This year, however, marks a pivot. From January to October 2025, the rate has trended downward, with a 90-day average of 68.16 AFN per USD and a -3.51% change. The 30-day high was 68.10 in early October, dipping to a low of 66.48, reflecting a consistent appreciation of the Afghani. Over the past month alone, the Afghani has strengthened by 2.04% against the USD.

## Key Drivers Behind the Afghani's Strength

What fuels this unexpected resilience? Several interconnected factors are at play, showcasing effective, albeit unconventional, economic stewardship.

### 1. Stringent Monetary Policies and Currency Controls

The Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) has implemented rigorous measures to curb capital flight and stabilize supply. By prohibiting unauthorized dollar outflows, regulating imports, and capping informal hawala transactions, the central bank has injected confidence into the market. Foreign currency auctions—selling USD accrued from UN aid in exchange for AFN—have directly bolstered the rate, removing excess local currency from circulation and appreciating the Afghani by up to 25% in targeted interventions.

### 2. Surge in Exports and Reduced Trade Deficits

Exports have ballooned from $840 million in prior years to over $2 billion in the last fiscal period, driven by mineral extraction and new trade ties, particularly with China. This influx of foreign earnings has narrowed the trade deficit, reducing dollar demand for imports and naturally strengthening the Afghani. Resumed infrastructure projects have further supported this export-led growth.

### 3. Remittances, Aid, and Controlled Inflation

Personal remittances from the Afghan diaspora continue to flow, often converted directly to AFN, providing a steady dollar supply without inflationary pressure. International aid, delivered via UN cash shipments, has been pivotal since early 2022, stabilizing liquidity despite shrinking volumes in 2025. Coupled with controlled money supply and appropriate interest rates, these have kept inflation in check, fostering investor trust.

## Implications: A Double-Edged Sword?

This dollar depreciation brings mixed fortunes. For importers and dollar-dependent sectors like fuel and tech, costs have eased, potentially lowering consumer prices. Exporters, however, may face reduced competitiveness abroad as their goods become pricier in USD terms.

Yet, the gains aren't evenly felt. While the exchange rate bolsters official reserves and reduces import bills, everyday Afghans grapple with poverty, unemployment, and aid cuts. Critics argue the surge is "artificial," propped by controls rather than broad-based growth, and may not translate to widespread prosperity. Forecasts predict the trend to continue, with rates potentially dipping to 63.90 AFN per USD by year-end, averaging 65.27 for 2025.

## Conclusion: Stability on the Horizon?

The Afghani's defiance against the USD underscores Afghanistan's adaptive economic strategies amid isolation. As remittances flow and exports grow, this strengthening could pave the way for sustainable recovery—if paired with inclusive policies and eased sanctions. For now, it's a testament to resilience: in a world of giants, the underdog currency is holding its own.
